Matrix Scalar Multiplication
Let 
 be a matrix of dimensions 
, and let 
 be a scalar. Then the product of matrix 
 and scalar 
 is the matrix 
 of dimensions 
, where

# Example 1: Matrix addition in sympy
import sympy as sp

A=sp.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]])
B=sp.Matrix([[5,6],[7,8]])
A # display matrix A
     

B # display matrix B
     

sp.Matrix([[6,8],[10,12]])==A+B # verify matrix addition
     

# Example 2: Scalar multiplication
A=sp.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]) # define matrix A

sp.Matrix([[2,4],[6,8]])==2*A # verify scalar multiplication
     

# Example 3: Multiplication of two matrices

A=sp.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4]]) # define matrix A
B=sp.Matrix([[5,6],[7,8]]) # define matrix B

sp.Matrix([[19,22],[43,50]])==A*B # verify matrix multiplication
     
Necessary Condition for Matrix Multiplication
Remember that matrices can have different numbers of rows and columns.

To multiply two matrices 
 and 
, where 
 has dimensions 
 and 
 has dimensions 
, the number of columns of matrix 
 must equal the number of rows of matrix 
. Otherwise, matrix multiplication is not possible.


For example, if 
 and 
, then the resulting matrix 
.

Matrix Multiplication is Not Commutative
Matrix multiplication is not commutative, i.e., in general 
.


# Example of multiplying rectangular matrices
import sympy as sp
A=sp.Matrix([[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]]) # define matrix A_{3 x 2}
B=sp.Matrix([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]) # define matrix B_{2 x 3}
C=sp.Matrix([[9,12,15],[19,26,33],[29,40,51]]) # define matrix C_{3 x 3}

A*B # multiply matrices A and B to get a 3x3 matrix
     
 

B*A # multiply matrices B and A to get a 2x2 matrix
     
 

B*C # multiply matrices B and C to get a 2x3 matrix
